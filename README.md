# Waste_Classification_using_CNN
# Automated Waste Classification using CNN

## Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for automated waste classification. The model categorizes waste into different types to promote efficient recycling and waste management. 

## Features
- Image-based waste classification using deep learning
- Preprocessing and augmentation of waste images
- Model training and evaluation with TensorFlow/Keras
- Deployment-ready with Flask for real-world applications

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **Flask** (for API deployment)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data handling)

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing images of different waste categories, such as:
- Plastic
- Paper
- Glass
- Metal
- Organic waste

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/waste-classification-cnn.git
   cd waste-classification-cnn
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the training script:
   ```sh
   python train.py
   ```
5. Start the Flask API (if deploying the model):
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Train the model using `train.py`
- Evaluate model performance using `evaluate.py`
- Deploy the trained model via `app.py` (Flask API)
- Test with sample images using `predict.py`

## Model Performance
- Achieved **accuracy: ~85-95%** on test data.
- Uses **data augmentation** for better generalization.
- Optimized with techniques like **dropout and batch normalization**.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve dataset size and diversity
- Implement real-time waste detection using a camera
- Deploy as a mobile or web application
